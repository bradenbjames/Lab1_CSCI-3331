1. The getter method is a method that returns the value of the attribute, while the setter takes a parameter and assigns it to the attribute.
2. I think it's a good idea because it doesn't allow any other classes to change the values, which could potentially crash the code.
3. A constructor is a unique method that can initializes objects. The method is called when the class is created.
4. It is the automatic constructor created by the compiler if you did not define it.__You can have more than one constructor__ 
5. Yes, this is known as overloading, and you would have to have them take different parameters.
6. Yes, the constructor executes when the object is created in memory.
